# 👋 Hi, my name is Giovani.
- 🔮 I am an electrical engineer that enjoyed programming subjecs during college (C, Java and Assembly / about 10 years ago).
- 🎯 After graduation, I worked mostly with financial planning and analysis and strategic planning.
- 🎯 Now, I'm pursuing a career related to IT.
- 🤖 I've worked 6 months with low-code RPA using **Python** and **AHK**.
- 🎯 I’m currently getting deeper into Python and trying to figure out which field to work in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to **collaborate** on anything as long as it has a **righteous** cause and provide me with opportunity to learn.
