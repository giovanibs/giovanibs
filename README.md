# 👋 Hello, I'm Giovani, an electrical engineer with a passion for programming.

🎓 While studying in college (about 10 years ago), I found joy in subjects like C, Java, and Assembly.

🔮 After graduating, I ventured into the realm of financial planning, analysis, and strategic planning. However, I am now actively pursuing a career in the field of IT.

🎯 I have gained experience in low-code Robotic Process Automation (RPA) using Python and AHK over a span of 6 months.

🔍 Currently, I am diving deeper into Python and exploring various fields to find the right fit for my career.

💞 I'm open to collaborating on projects that align with a just cause and offer opportunities for learning.
